# ZAPS: A Payments Simulator

See what I did with the name ;)

For learning some Rust fundamentals inc. networking, multi-threading, futures, etc.

Inspired by an 8583 simulator I wrote at a previous place in Java so I have a good idea of what needs to be done even if I'm
not sure yet how I'll accomplish it!
